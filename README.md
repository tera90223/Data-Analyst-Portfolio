# Data-Analyst-Portfolio

## Introduction
This repository is mainly for projects and certificates I have completed as an Aspiring Data Engineer under CodeAcademy. 

I am currently completing the Data Scientist Pathway on CodeAcademy and have completed 47% of the path thus far. CodeAcademy has aided me in loading, verifying, organizing, analyzing, and visualizing data. I am able to uncover patterns in the data and draw meaningful conclusions from my findings using libraries such as Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit learn, and scipy.
