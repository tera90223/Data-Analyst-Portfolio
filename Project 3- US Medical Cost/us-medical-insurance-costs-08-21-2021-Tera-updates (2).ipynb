During the process, I noticed that the code was becoming repetitive, and that led me to create functions for specific processes. \n",

For instance, I could not analyze my sex column, which already have 2 defined categories, like my age column, which is a numerical variable with infinite range. This made me modify my functions a bit, and I do think there is room for growth in fixing the functions.\n",

I felt that reporting those numbers may not be beneficial if it is not coupled with a visual analysis plot such as a histogram. My original goal was to include visual plots, but I decided I wanted to limit myself to functions I created, and at this moment, I do not have the knowledge to create a function that builds different graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I noticed that currently my summary analysis only compares a column to charges and I wanted to compare more than one comlumn for a more complex analysis. Plus my analysis provided a summary, but did not answer a question. The first question that popped up in my head was What would this data tell me about Who Spends More On HealthCare -Men vs Women. I did notice some setbacks as I would have liked a visual graph to show the differences. I also asked a very general question, and although the averages support men pay more than women, it does not actually answer the question. So I do realize I cannot say Men pay more than Women as that is not entirely true, only that the averages for men's insurance costs are higher than women's insurance costs for any age group concerning this data."
